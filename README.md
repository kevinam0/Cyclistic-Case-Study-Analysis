# Google Data Analytics Captsone: Cyclistic Case Study

Welcome!

This is my capstone project for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Presented in the final course, it will be used to culminate and showcase all that has been learned throughout this program into a case study analysis. The case study will lay out a real-world business problem to be tackled using the 6 Phase Analysis methodology (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act) that has been a focal point of the program.

Attached is my [case study analysis](https://github.com/kevinam0/Cyclistic-Case-Study-Analysis/blob/4dc7336ca68e07d398e73a8e8560619c527995d0/google-data-analytics-capstone-cyclistic%20(3).ipynb) (along with its supporting [code](https://github.com/kevinam0/Cyclistic-Case-Study-Analysis/blob/4dc7336ca68e07d398e73a8e8560619c527995d0/Cyclistic%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Analysis.R)) of Cyclistic; a fictitious bike-share company based on historical data of real Chicago bike-share company, Divvy.
